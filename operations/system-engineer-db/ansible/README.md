## âš™ Approach for Ansible Environemnts

On this task you're presented with a small work in progress ansible configuration automation.

The goal of this assesment:
- summarize what the task is doing
- find improvements
- spot errors
- suggest optimizations
- suggest possible integration scenarios

The task is not to identify everything that there is, but to show your understanding of Ansible and explain your throught process.

--> The main process starts here with this [playbook](https://github.com/endresshauser-infoserve/tech-assesments/blob/main/operations/system-engineer-db/ansible/psql_create_user.yaml)
